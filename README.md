# IconSetGenerator Gradle Plugin
The IconSetGenerator Gradle plugin streamlines the management of drawable resources in your Kotlin projects. It automatically scans your project's `res/drawable` directory for XML files, specifically those prefixed with `ic_`, and generates a single, type-safe Kotlin object. This object contains properties for each icon, providing compile-time safety and eliminating the need for manual resource declarations.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Automatic Scanning:** Finds all XML files starting with `ic_` within the `res/drawable` directory.

- **Type-Safe References:** Generates a Kotlin object with properties for each icon, providing compile-time safety and IDE auto-completion.

- **Seamless Integration:** Integrates directly into the Gradle build process, ensuring generated code is always up-to-date.

- **Customizable:** Configure the output package name and class name to fit your project's needs.

## üöÄ Usage
Using the plugin involves a two-step process to ensure a clean, centralized approach for managing the version across your project.

First, add the plugin to your project-level `build.gradle.kts` file. Use apply false to prevent it from being applied globally.

```kotlin
plugins {
  id("es.devdiestrolopez.iconset.generator") version "1.0.0" apply false
}
```

Next, apply the plugin in the `build.gradle.kts` file of the specific module where the icons resources reside and where the files will be generated.

```kotlin
plugins {
  id("es.devdiestrolopez.iconset.generator")
}
```

Finally, configure the plugin by creating an `iconSet` block. You can customize the package and file name for the generated code. If no configuration is needed, the `iconSet` block can be removed.

```kotlin
iconSet {
  // (Optional) The package where the generated class will be created.
  // By default, this is set to `<your_module_package_name>.ui`
  outputPackage.set("com.example.app.ui.icons")
  
  // (Optional) The name of the generated Kotlin object.
  // By default, this is set to "IconSet"
  fileName.set("AppIcons")
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
- The IconSetGeneratorPlugin applies a task that reads all files in your `res/drawable` directory that match the `ic_*.xml` pattern.

- For each icon file (e.g., ic_my_icon.xml), it generates a corresponding property in a new Kotlin file. The property name is derived by removing the `ic_` prefix and `.xml` extension and converting the name to PascalCase (e.g., ic_my_icon.xml becomes MyIcon).

- The generated file is placed in the `build/generated/source/main` directory under the configured package.

- The generated properties are of type `DrawableResource`, which holds the `@DrawableRes` integer ID for the icon. The `DrawableResource` class extends a sealed interface named `IconResource`.
  ```kotlin
  sealed interface IconResource
  data class DrawableResource(@DrawableRes val id: Int) : IconResource
  ```

This generated file is automatically included in your module's source set, making the `IconSet` object available for use throughout your code.

## üì¶ Generated Output
After running a Gradle build, you will find a generated file similar to the one below in your build directory. You can then use the `IconSet` object directly in your Kotlin code.

```kotlin
// Example generated file: build/generated/source/main/com/example/app/ui/icons/AppIcons.kt

package com.example.app.ui.icons

object AppIcons {
  val MyIcon: DrawableResource = DrawableResource(id = R.drawable.ic_my_icon)
  val AnotherIcon: DrawableResource = DrawableResource(id = R.drawable.ic_another_icon)
  // ... more icons
}
```

## üëÄ Future Scope & Usage
Currently, the plugin's generation capabilities are limited to drawable resources (DrawableResource). Future development will expand this functionality to include support for vector images (ImageVectorResource), which are commonly used with libraries like Material Icons.

It's important to note that this plugin is intended to be a foundational component. Its full value is realized when used in conjunction with a small, companion Jetpack Compose library that I will also be developing. This library will offer a unified Icon composable that can gracefully handle both DrawableResource and ImageVectorResource types, providing a seamless and consistent API for your UI code.
